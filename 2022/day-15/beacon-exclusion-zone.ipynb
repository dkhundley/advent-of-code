You don't have time to search them all, but you don't need to: your pack contains a set of deployable sensors that you imagine were originally built to locate lost Elves.\n\nThe sensors aren't very powerful, but that's okay; your handheld device indicates that you're close enough to the source of the distress signal to use them. You pull the emergency sensor system out of your pack, hit the big button on top, and the sensors zoom off down the tunnels.\n\nOnce a sensor finds a spot it thinks will give it a good reading, it attaches itself to a hard surface and begins monitoring for the nearest signal source beacon. Sensors and beacons always exist at integer coordinates. Each sensor knows its own position and can determine the position of a beacon precisely; however, sensors can only lock on to the one beacon closest to the sensor as measured by the Manhattan distance. (There is never a tie where two beacons are the same distance to a sensor.)\n\nIt doesn't take long for the sensors to report back their positions and closest beacons (your puzzle input). For example:\n```\nSensor at x=2, y=18: closest beacon is at x=-2, y=15\nSensor at x=9, y=16: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16\nSensor at x=13, y=2: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3\nSensor at x=12, y=14: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16\nSensor at x=10, y=20: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16\nSensor at x=14, y=17: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16\nSensor at x=8, y=7: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10\nSensor at x=2, y=0: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10\nSensor at x=0, y=11: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10\nSensor at x=20, y=14: closest beacon is at x=25, y=17\nSensor at x=17, y=20: closest beacon is at x=21, y=22\nSensor at x=16, y=7: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3\nSensor at x=14, y=3: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3\nSensor at x=20, y=1: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3\n```\nSo, consider the sensor at 2,18; the closest beacon to it is at -2,15. For the sensor at 9,16, the closest beacon to it is at 10,16.\n\nDrawing sensors as S and beacons as B, the above arrangement of sensors and beacons looks like this:\n```\n               1    1    2    2\n     0    5    0    5    0    5\n 0 ....S.......................\n 1 ......................S.....\n 2 ...............S............\n 3 ................SB..........\n 4 ............................\n 5 ............................\n 6 ............................\n 7 ..........S.......S.........\n 8 ............................\n 9 ............................\n10 ....B.......................\n11 ..S.........................\n12 ............................\n13 ............................\n14 ..............S.......S.....\n15 B...........................\n16 ...........SB...............\n17 ................S..........B\n18 ....S.......................\n19 ............................\n20 ............S......S........\n21 ............................\n22 .......................B....\n```\nThis isn't necessarily a comprehensive map of all beacons in the area, though. Because each sensor only identifies its closest beacon, if a sensor detects a beacon, you know there are no other beacons that close or closer to that sensor. There could still be beacons that just happen to not be the closest beacon to any sensor. Consider the sensor at 8,7:\n```\n               1    1    2    2\n     0    5    0    5    0    5\n-2 ..........#.................\n-1 .........###................\n 0 ....S...#####...............\n 1 .......#######........S.....\n 2 ......#########S............\n 3 .....###########SB..........\n 4 ....#############...........\n 5 ...###############..........\n 6 ..#################.........\n 7 .#########S#######S#........\n 8 ..#################.........\n 9 ...###############..........\n10 ....B############...........\n11 ..S..###########............\n12 ......#########.............\n13 .......#######..............\n14 ........#####.S.......S.....\n15 B........###................\n16 ..........#SB...............\n17 ................S..........B\n18 ....S.......................\n19 ............................\n20 ............S......S........\n21 ............................\n22 .......................B....\n```\nThis sensor's closest beacon is at 2,10, and so you know there are no beacons that close or closer (in any positions marked #).\n\nNone of the detected beacons seem to be producing the distress signal, so you'll need to work out where the distress beacon is by working out where it isn't. For now, keep things simple by counting the positions where a beacon cannot possibly be along just a single row.\n\nSo, suppose you have an arrangement of beacons and sensors like in the example above and, just in the row where y=10, you'd like to count the number of positions a beacon cannot possibly exist. The coverage from all sensors near that row looks like this:\n```\n                 1    1    2    2\n       0    5    0    5    0    5\n 9 ...#########################...\n10 ..####B######################..\n11 .###S#############.###########.\n```\nIn this example, in the row where y=10, there are 26 positions where a beacon cannot be present.\n\nConsult the report from the sensors you just deployed. In the row where y=2000000, how many positions cannot contain a beacon?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import re\n\n# Loading up the input file\nwith open('input.txt', 'r') as f:\n    sensors_and_beacons = f.read().splitlines()\n    \nsample_input = [\n    'Sensor at x=2, y=18: closest beacon is at x=-2, y=15',\n    'Sensor at x=9, y=16: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16',\n    'Sensor at x=13, y=2: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3',\n    'Sensor at x=12, y=14: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16',\n    'Sensor at x=10, y=20: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16',\n    'Sensor at x=14, y=17: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16',\n    'Sensor at x=8, y=7: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10',\n    'Sensor at x=2, y=0: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10',\n    'Sensor at x=0, y=11: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10',\n    'Sensor at x=20, y=14: closest beacon is at x=25, y=17',\n    'Sensor at x=17, y=20: closest beacon is at x=21, y=22',\n    'Sensor at x=16, y=7: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3',\n    'Sensor at x=14, y=3: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3',\n    'Sensor at x=20, y=1: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3'\n]\n\nsensors_and_beacons = sample_input","execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Instantiating a list to hold all the sensor/beacon coordinates\nsb_coords = []\n\n# Iterating over all the string-based inputs\nfor sb_pair in sensors_and_beacons:\n    \n    # Setting a list to hold the S/B pair coordinates\n    sb_pair_coords = []\n    \n    # Setting a regex pattern to extract out both sets of coordinates\n    regex_pattern = r\"x=(-?\\d+), y=(-?\\d+)\"\n    \n    # Getting the matches using the regex pattern\n    matches = re.findall(regex_pattern, sb_pair)\n    \n    # Adding the respective S/B coordinates to sb_pair_coords\n    for x, y in matches:\n        sb_pair_coords.append([int(x), int(y)])\n    \n    # Adding paired coordinates to collective list\n    sb_coords.append(sb_pair_coords)","execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sb_coords[0]","execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":21,"data":{"text/plain":"[[2, 18], [-2, 15]]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
