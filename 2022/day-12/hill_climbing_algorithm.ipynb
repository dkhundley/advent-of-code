The heightmap shows the local area from above broken into a grid; the elevation of each square of the grid is given by a single lowercase letter, where a is the lowest elevation, b is the next-lowest, and so on up to the highest elevation, z.\n","\n","Also included on the heightmap are marks for your current position (S) and the location that should get the best signal (E). Your current position (S) has elevation a, and the location that should get the best signal (E) has elevation z.\n","\n","You'd like to reach E, but to save energy, you should do it in as few steps as possible. During each step, you can move exactly one square up, down, left, or right. To avoid needing to get out your climbing gear, the elevation of the destination square can be at most one higher than the elevation of your current square; that is, if your current elevation is m, you could step to elevation n, but not to elevation o. (This also means that the elevation of the destination square can be much lower than the elevation of your current square.)\n","\n","For example:\n","\n","```\n","Sabqponm\n","abcryxxl\n","accszExk\n","acctuvwj\n","abdefghi\n","```\n","\n","Here, you start in the top-left corner; your goal is near the middle. You could start by moving down or right, but eventually you'll need to head toward the e at the bottom.

The location that should get the best signal is still E, and . marks unvisited squares.\n","\n","This path reaches the goal in 31 steps, the fewest possible.\n","\n","What is the fewest steps required to move from your current position to the location that should get the best signal?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"source":["#TODO\n","\n","# Create the map\n","# Find the starting and end points\n","# Instantiate infinite values for all unvisited points\n","# Instantiate thing to note visited nodes\n","# Start at the starting position and mark as visited\n","# Add all (in bounds) unvisited neighbors to priority queue (each entry in priority queue needs distance to node and that node's position)\n","# Go and do the same for the next nearest node, but adding the distance to that node"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["[['S', 'a', 'b', 'q', 'p', 'o', 'n', 'm'],\n"," ['a', 'b', 'c', 'r', 'y', 'x', 'x', 'l'],\n"," ['a', 'c', 'c', 's', 'z', 'E', 'x', 'k'],\n"," ['a', 'c', 'c', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'j'],\n"," ['a', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i']]"]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Setting the sample for testing purposes\n","dummy_map = '''Sabqponm\n","abcryxxl\n","accszExk\n","acctuvwj\n","abdefghi\n","'''.splitlines()\n","\n","# Reading in the input file\n","with open('input.txt') as f:\n","    elevation_map = f.read().splitlines()\n","\n","elevation_map = dummy_map\n","\n","# Converting the lists of strings to be their own values\n","elevation_map = [list(line) for line in elevation_map]\n","elevation_map"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"source":["# Getting the rows and columns of the elevation map\n","rows, cols = len(elevation_map), len(elevation_map[0])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Starting location: [0, 0]\n","Ending location: [2, 5]\n"]}],"source":["# Iterating over all the rows then columns to find the starting and ending positions\n","for row in range(rows):\n","    for col in range(cols):\n","        \n","        #
