After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the Ceres monitoring station!\n\nAs the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: XMAS.\n\nThis word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways XMAS might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with .:\n\n```\n..X...\n.SAMX.\n.A..A.\nXMAS.S\n.X....\n```\n\nThe actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:\n\n```\nMMMSXXMASM\nMSAMXMSMSA\nAMXSXMAAMM\nMSAMASMSMX\nXMASAMXAMM\nXXAMMXXAMA\nSMSMSASXSS\nSAXAMASAAA\nMAMMMXMMMM\nMXMXAXMASX\n```\n\nIn this word search, XMAS occurs a total of 18 times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any XMAS have been replaced with .:\n\n```\n....XXMAS.\n.SAMXMS...\n...S..A...\n..A.A.MS.X\nXMASAMX.MM\nX.....XA.A\nS.S.S.S.SS\n.A.A.A.A.A\n..M.M.M.MM\n.X.X.XMASX\n```\n\nTake a look at the little Elf's word search. How many times does XMAS appear?"
